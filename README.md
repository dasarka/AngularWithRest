# AngularWithRest
This is my first angulas js application with rest api.
I used Java as backend language and JERSEY server to design REST API. 


MY REST API will return a json data when we call (url: http://localhost:8080/AngularWithRest/RestCall/Welcome/JSON). The response is given below:
{"key1":"Hello Rest API","key2":"Developed by ARKA DAS"}

In this application, i hit the link from front-end and bind the response within particular HTML tag using angular js.
